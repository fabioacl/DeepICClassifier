# DeepICClassifier

- DeepICClassifier.h5 contains the ensemble deep neural network developed in our work. It can be loaded using Keras Library. An example is presented in loading_example.py.

- Standardisation Values.pkl contains the mean and standard devation used to standardise the input samples.
